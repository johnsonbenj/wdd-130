        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Programming is necessary, today in my country schools will begin to teach programming, so many young people will begin to be interested and see it as a necessity, so that later in the future knowing how to program will not be simply a A good option, but it will become a necessity, so young people between 12 and 18 years old will begin to look for more about programming, as well as older people, this is due to the fact that in the jobs more qualified people are greatly exceeded, knowing how to program is an essential requirement. . During my time at school, the programming language we used the most was HTML and C++ to make web pages, now having more knowledge and knowing that it is more professional to use HTML AND CSS and adding Python here as important and basic languages, my goal is to be able to help people to have a knowledge in these languages and also help in possible projects and tasks. That is why having a site to offer these programming services will be of the utmost importance and given the aforementioned, several young people will look for this page.

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/homepage-1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="images/homepage.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Seek help </h3>
      <p>
        On the page there will be several options to navigate among which the people who enter will be able to access the help services by sending a WhatsApp message, Messenger or an email in which they will place or send part of their code that is not working or explain that they must carry out and responding to those messages, they can stay in a possible meeting through a platform that allows it to be able to help or guide them as the person needs, either for HTML and CSS bone web pages or Python programs, they will also simply be able to observe examples about how the grids or the wireframe work as well as asking how these work by the aforementioned means

      </ul>
      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
        The most striking part will be the didactics or games that there will be and these will vary in various ways, among these would be placing a code that it executes and/or has several other parts and the user's objective will be to copy and fix it, this would be both in HTML, CSS and Python also place images with simple codes in which the user will be able to answer himself what will be the output or the result of the code this in both HTML, CSS and Python there would also be access to slightly more specific areas but this would come more specifically for Python and although they may not be games or activities, they can be explanations about the use of this programming language in mathematics such as calculating areas, factoring, derivatives or integrals, in physics such as calculating speeds, specific formulas such as free fall, flight time etc. Chemistry such as electron configuration, valence tables, atomic weights, atomic numbers, organic and inorganic chemistry. Also a part for the application of these not simply to these topics but also everyday life and work such as alarms or optimization methods.
